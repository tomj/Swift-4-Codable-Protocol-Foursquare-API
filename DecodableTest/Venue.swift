/* JSON objects that are nested inside others MUST be parsed in the following format.  Failure to do so will result in a crash.  I recommend using the 'Postman' application to properly view the JSON.
 
 Declarations of the objects must also be spelled exactly as they appear in the JSON.  This will also result in a crash if not done properly.
