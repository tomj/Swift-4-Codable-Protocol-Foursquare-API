# DecodableTest
The best way to find nearby vegan restaurants using the new Swift 4 Codable protocol

The new Swift 4 'Codable' protocol is fast, powerful and easy to use in any project that requires parsing easy to complex JSON.

This sample project demonstrates the protocol with the Foursquare API and parses the URL for nearby vegan restaurants.
Perfect if you have a project that needs to find nearby vegan venues, but it'll work for any other parameter you choose to pass in the URL.

To get your unique "client ID" and "Client secret" go to   https://developer.foursquare.com

Copy and paste these into the URL inside your project.
Run, then tap on the button on the main screen to view the objects fully parsed and ready for use.
